**Powerful tool for optimizing trade-up contracts in CS2!**

CS Float Calculator is an essential Python application for Counter-Strike 2 players who want to maximize their benefits from trade-up contracts 💰. Whether you want to accurately calculate the final float or find the perfect combination of skins 🎯, this application will help you achieve your desired result!

### ✨ Key Features:

#### 📊 1. Calculate Final Float:

*   **Easy Data Input:** Simply enter the float values of 10 skins you plan to use in the contract.
*   **Accurate Calculations:** Applies the exact calculation formula from CS2 to determine the final float.

#### 🔎 2. Find Combinations for Desired Float:

*   **Flexible Settings:** Specify the minimum and maximum float values for your desired skin.
*   **Powerful Analysis:** Uses a custom list of float values to find the best combinations.
*   **Optimal Combinations:** Finds combinations that are most likely to result in the desired float.
*   **Search Control:** Set the maximum number of combinations to check and stop the search at any time.
*   **Convenient Output:** Displays results as a list with the final float value.

### ⚙️ Key Highlights:

*   🎨 **Intuitive Interface:** Application built with `flet` featuring a scalable and attractive interface.
*   ✅ **Accurate Calculation:** Uses the proven CS2 formula for high accuracy.
*   ⚙️ **Flexible Settings:** Numerous parameters to customize according to your needs.
*   ⏱️ **Time-Saving:** Eliminate manual calculations and experiments.
*   📈 **Contract Optimization:** Increase your chances of getting skins with the desired floats.
*   🧮 **Filtering Feature:** Filter out unnecessary float values to improve search efficiency.
*   ⚡️ **Asynchronous Search:** `asyncio` ensures high speed and responsiveness of the application.
*   🛡️ **Data Validation:** Prevents errors through input validation.

### 🛠️ Technologies:

*   🐍 **Python**
*   🖼️ **flet** (for graphical interface)
*   🔍 **re** (for working with regular expressions)
*   ⏳ **asyncio** (for asynchronous programming)
*   📦 **struct** (for working with binary data)
*   🔀 **itertools** (for working with combinations)

### 🎯 Who is it for?

*   🕹️ **Active CS2 players:** Who use trade-up contracts.
*   💎 **Skin collectors:** Who are looking for skins with specific floats.
*   💰 **Traders and speculators:** Who want to maximize their profits.
*   ⏰ **Everyone who values their time and resources!**

### ⚠️ Important to Know:

*   ℹ️ This application is designed to assist in calculations and does not guarantee a 100% result.
*   📊 The float of the resulting skin has a degree of randomness within the CS2 formula.
*   🔄 It is recommended to use up-to-date skin float data.
